# SattimSatiyorum

This project is a backend service which built with **Spring Boot** and using **MySQL** database for storing information purpose. The main idea is to simulate a connection
between a seller and a buyer. Sellers can create products with their commercials information, buyers can buy products by making an update to the commercial that is
related to the product. A product can has many feature options which are related to features.Users can filter and search commercials by their active status,
feature options, price,dates,urgent status. Users have a default package which limit their seller behaivour. There are other packages which increases the 
limitation for that seller behaivour.
